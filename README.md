# Exploratory Data Analysis Week 1 project.

## Summary of project requirements.

This project requires creation of four separate R script files that create graphs using R's base plotting capability. Each file will generate one plot and save it in PNG format.

Data for the plots can be downloaded at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Data must be subsetted to include only values from dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.

R script files are to be named Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R.

PNG files are to be named Plot1.PNG, Plot2.PNG, Plot3.PNG and Plot4.PNG.
